# Introduction
  An Introduction to Computer Graphics assignment , where we learnt how to implement the Midline point algorithm also known as Bresenham's Algorithm.
  The ultimate goal is to create a graphical pipeline from scratch.
  
### Drawing Lines 
  ![Lines on all axis](https://github.com/flaviosms/Pipeline/blob/master/Axis.JPG)
  
    On this part , i draw a line for each direction to test if the function was working properly for all octants.
  
### Random Lines
  ![Lines with randomized color and endpoints starting from the center](https://github.com/flaviosms/Pipeline/blob/master/RandomLine.JPG)
  
    Here I randomized the endpoint of the lines to create an intersting pattern.
  
### Drawing Triangles
  ![Triangles drawn with the DrawTriangle function one filled up and the other only the borders](https://github.com/flaviosms/Pipeline/blob/master/Triangles.JPG)
  
    Here i used the DrawTriangle() function , which has 2 ways of being called ,
    one that recieves 3 colors and the other that receives one ,the one that gets one color is
    filled up with that color ,the one that receives 3 colors will draw 3 lines and interpolate
    the colors between them.
